# Logistic Regression and Neural Network
Logistic Regression &amp; Neural Network - Quality check 


Problem	Unable to detect when product quality incident occurs
Solution	Use machine learning logistic regression with multiple inputs to predict a quality issue
Hypothesis	Find that individual properties on their own will not be enough to confidently predict a product quality incident
Purpose	Select threshold value to correctly identify product quality issue, but not too low that false positives become frequent
	
	
Data Set	Manipulate data set using pandas/numpy i.e. fill in missing data points
Data Set	Scrub instrumentation for periods of maintenance, sample data when unit outage
Data Set	Make sample point from text to numeric (i.e. <1 to 1)
Data Set	Significant figures rounding
Data Set	Add charge rate rate of change column
Data Set	Show key parameters that had largest impact on graph using matplot
Data Set	2015-2016 missing filter dp and sample analysis
Data Set 	"- Split using testing and training to check accuracy of model prediction i.e. use 80% training and 20% testing
- Use ROC curve to help choose optimum threshold values for key parameters
- ROC = Receiver Operator Curve i.e. graph true positive rate versus false positive rate"
